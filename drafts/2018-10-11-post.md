When a person considers a situations, they often intuitively incorporate other information they have been given in order to provide context. This study was concerned generally with how individuals perceive ambiguous actions by police in light of other background information, and specifically with the concept of hindsight bias. To test our hypotheses, we embedded a set of experimental vignettes in the survey you just took using a randomized factorial design. Thus, while most of the questions were the same for everyone, the background details you read before watching the video were randomized. These details included, for instance, what we told you that John Smith was holding. We randomized whether these details were present or not in order to examine the causal impact of those details on estimates of the justifiability, reasonableness, and necessity of the police officers' actions.
